# Vue 3 + Vite + TailwindCSS/SASS Boilerplate

This template should help get you started developing quicker with Vue 3 in Vite along with tailwindCSS and SASS. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## To get started

Once you have cloned the repo, do the following commands
<pre>npm i</pre>
<pre>npm run host</pre>

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)

## Changes

- added 'npm run host' which will then give you a local and network address. (helpful for testing on mobile devices)
- SASS has been configured. for more information look here https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css
